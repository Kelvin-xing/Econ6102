abstract = {ABSTRACT Innovations in statistical technology in functions including credit-screening have raised concerns about distributional impacts across categories such as race. Theoretically, distributional effects of better statistical technology can come from greater flexibility to uncover structural relationships or from triangulation of otherwise excluded characteristics. Using data on U.S. mortgages, we predict default using traditional and machine learning models. We find that Black and Hispanic borrowers are disproportionately less likely to gain from the introduction of machine learning. In a simple equilibrium credit market model, machine learning increases disparity in rates between and within groups, with these changes attributable primarily to greater flexibility.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Using a sample of small firms that defaulted on their bank debt in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we find that large differences in creditors' rights across countries lead banks to adjust their lending and reorganization practices to mitigate costly aspects of bankruptcy law. In particular, French banks respond to a creditor-unfriendly code by requiring more collateral than lenders elsewhere, and by relying on collateral forms that minimize the statutory dilution of their claims in bankruptcy. Despite such adjustments, bank recovery rates in default remain sharply different across the three countries, reflecting very different levels of creditor protection.},

abstract = {Machine-learning methods exploit fund characteristics to select tradable long-only portfolios of mutual funds that earn significant out-of-sample annual alphas of 2.4\% net of all costs. The methods unveil interactions in the relation between fund characteristics and future performance. For instance, past performance is a particularly strong predictor of future performance for more active funds. Machine learning identifies managers whose skill is not sufficiently offset by diseconomies of scale, consistent with informational frictions preventing investors from identifying the outperforming funds. Our findings demonstrate that investors can benefit from active management, but only if they have access to sophisticated prediction methods.}

abstract = {Owing to the convenience of online loans, an increasing number of people are borrowing money on online platforms. With the emergence of machine learning technology, predicting loan defaults has become a popular topic. However, machine learning models have a black-box problem that cannot be disregarded. To make the prediction model rules more understandable and thereby increase the user’s faith in the model, an explanatory model must be used. Logistic regression, decision tree, XGBoost, and LightGBM models are employed to predict a loan default. The prediction results show that LightGBM and XGBoost outperform logistic regression and decision tree models in terms of the predictive ability. The area under curve for LightGBM is 0.7213. The accuracies of LightGBM and XGBoost exceed 0.8. The precisions of LightGBM and XGBoost exceed 0.55. Simultaneously, we employed the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations approach to undertake an explainable analysis of the prediction findings. The results show that factors such as the loan term, loan grade, credit rating, and loan amount affect the predicted outcomes.}
