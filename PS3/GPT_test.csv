Operator,Q,A
"Thank you Mr. Adrian. Today's Q&A session will be conducted electronically and if you would like to ask a question
you may do so by pressing the ""*"" key followed by the ""1"" on your touchtone telephone. Again that is ""*"" ""1"" for
questions today. We will be taking first question from Edward White with Lehman Brothers.","Hi, in the semiconductor business which is one of the areas that you are looking for to come back, can you talk
about what you can do to respond to strong demand for FBAR and other products that are relatively strong, you talked
about capacity constraints there and can you talk about why that's happening and what you can do to get around that?","Yeah, we been ramping as fast as we can, and as a result of the increase demand we have had the keep one of our
fabs here Bay area open longer than we had planned. We originally had planned to move all our fabs from the Bay area
to Fort Collins [ph] and that process is underway and in fact those bad fab is ramping in Fort Collins. But given the
demand we had to keep our fab open in New York for about 6 months longer than we originally expected. We still
expect that fab to be closing over the next several months, but we were not able to get the benefits cost wise of
consolidating into a single fab as quickly as we would like. But we are able to keep up with customer demand, we have
not missed our customer commitments, I think that's important to recognize, but it has cost us a little bit more to do that
just because we had to leave this additional fab open."
"Thank you Mr. Adrian. Today's Q&A session will be conducted electronically and if you would like to ask a question
you may do so by pressing the ""*"" key followed by the ""1"" on your touchtone telephone. Again that is ""*"" ""1"" for
questions today. We will be taking first question from Edward White with Lehman Brothers.","Okay, any senses to how much that's been costing you? How much more would have been, you know, relative to
if you have been able to move more quickly the Fort Colins","Yeah, at a very conservative estimate would be $6mm to $8mm per quarter of additional cost just from keeping
that fab open let alone transportation, yield and other issues."
We go next to Dean Gray from Goldman Sachs.,"Good morning. Could we get the next layer of detail in the segments in terms of where the shortfall came in,
either you can give it to me sequentially or year-over-year in terms of how much of the volume, the margin hit came
from volume versus pricing, and I assume when you say the margin hit, that's all pricing?","Well, I think there is a couple of things, again Adrian can give some specifics. Clearly the overriding factor is
volume, and that really impacted all of our business even LSCA that had been running pretty strong had a downturn in
orders due to I think some of the macro economic effects in that chemical analysis and pharmaceutical market. So we
were hit across the board with volume impacts, which was really by far the largest impact on our cost of sales. Within
segments, we have seen a little bit of mixed difference. For example in our semiconductor products we have had some
stronger sales for some of these products that are ramping like FBAR filters and E-pHEMT which are not as profitable
today as some of the more mature products, like some of our fibre optic programs, which have not been growing as
fast. So, again that is part of the mix shift that is going on there. Within semiconductor test, we have also seen a little
bit of a mix shift towards some of the lower end platforms as opposed to some of the high end as customers are buying
more of the low end machines than the high end machines. But, again those I think are second order effects compared
to the overall volume issue. Let me turn it over to Adrian to add some comments."
We go next to Dean Gray from Goldman Sachs.,Adrian you said that the pricing impact was felt most on the semiconductor side the semiconductor products?,Semiconductor products side
We go next to Dean Gray from Goldman Sachs.,"Okay, so where is that standing in terms of the Com test side, optical, wireless, wireline, same sort of pricing
conditions?",Yes no real change from Q4 or Q3.
We go next to Dean Gray from Goldman Sachs.,"I think the biggest factor there, frankly particularly in the optical test areas is the grey market. In several of our
product lines like our manufacturing test products as well as the optical test, there still is a fairly large grey market out
there, used equipment for a number of older applications. Now, the good news is time goes on those do not fit a lot of
the newer applications so people are upgrading. But until we get through that that grey market issue we will have
continued pricing pressures, because we actually are selling and reselling our own used equipment as it comes off
leased or from our demo pools in competition with some of these grey market sales.","And I think a quarter ago, we said we were beginning to see some stability in that grey market pricing that
continued this quarter. It did not get worse. It did not get appreciable better."
We will take our next question for Jerry Fleming at [indiscernible] Stock.,"Yes I wonder Adrian if you could give us little bit of a feel for what the gross margin and cost structure looks like
in your model for this coming quarter?","We do not go there. We do not give a specific line item guidance. I think you can assume with the modest bump
up in volume that we expect and with the continued rapid progress in our restructuring that you would see an
improvement in both gross margins and support expenses."
And we will go next to Max Shutes [ph] at Credit Suisse First Boston.,"Hi, guys. I had a question on the pricing in your semiconductor products. If you could talk about which areas you
were seeing the most pressure there and then also if you had an idea when you were going to get to the New York Fab
shutdown?","I think it is hard to try to split all apart, because we have got so many different businesses, comparing to what
period of time. But if you look at some of the more traditional light emitting diode products, some of the Opto products
that we have sold for years. There is a pretty active spot market that is pretty competitive additive and again we have
taken a philosophy by the way as companies are really trying to squeeze their suppliers and with the competitive
market being as tough as it is, you know, we are walking away from what we call suicide bids. I mean some people are
bidding some ridiculous discounts just to win share and keep their light and heat going. We don't do that and we kind of
draw a line but at the same point and then just as continue to put more pressure on across the board. I can't give you an
exact break down of the spilt because it's pretty much across most of the businesses but we have seen it in some of the
more traditional products. First, where there is perhaps more competition and little less differentiation."
And we will go next to Max Shutes [ph] at Credit Suisse First Boston.,How would you characterize the pricing premium you are getting on some of newer RF products?,"Well, I think we still expect to make very good margin. As I mentioned earlier, we are still in a ramp mode so
these businesses are not running at the profit levels that we want them to run but we still think that we can offer
because we have some technological advantage in terms of size and in terms of the performance and in the FBAR filers
or in the power amplifier in the case of the efficiency that we operate. We don't have to be as aggressive there because
there is some clear differentiation, but again there is always competition and always pricing, it just kind of relative.
These are newer products so tend to have more differentiation than some of the more mature products."
And we go next to Richard Shoe with SG Cowen.,"Thank you, good morning. Got a couple of things, one Adrian. I am really confused about the cost expense
increasing here. Your total cost expenses in Q4 totalled a $1.770B, down about a $100mm from that in Q1 so I
understand the point that you made with respect to gross margin leverage that the operational performance exceeded
that, but I am puzzled why total cost expenses are down only a $100mm sequentially given volume reduction and the
restructuring effects that should still be playing out?","Richard, I am not sure I understand the question."
And we go next to Richard Shoe with SG Cowen.,You combined cost of goods and Opex numbers.,Yeah.
And we go next to Richard Shoe with SG Cowen.,For Q4 you showed that as a $1.770B.,Yeah.
And we go next to Richard Shoe with SG Cowen.,This quarter it is a $1.680B. That number is down about a $100mm.,Right.
And we go next to Richard Shoe with SG Cowen.,"So my question is with a $300mm decline in revenues, why the cost and expense is only down a $100mm.","Well, if you took a normal 70% decremental they wouldn't even be down that much because our material prices,
our material costs are only 30% of our total cost to good sold and so it is the pace of our restructuring that allows us to
improve that from what otherwise would be a much more severe reduction in our gross margins and much less
reduction in our ongoing cost. Again, I will also remind you that we had the absolute peak in our IT implementation
cost this quarter adding an additional roughly $45mm from the prior trend level of spending as we put in the CRM and
continued our implementation of the ERP"
And we go next to Richard Shoe with SG Cowen.,"So, you believe that given the volume level that your cost and expense performance was on time?",Yes.
And we go next to Richard Shoe with SG Cowen.,"Okay, let me not delay it. I will come back in followup on that later. On the discussion regarding FBAR and the
SPG products could you, [indiscernible] do you have an update on FBAR situation. You had most recently talked about
$2mm as the [indiscernible]. Are you substantially [indiscernible] and do you have any productions design in on
E-pHEMT that you can talk about?","I think what we just announced Richard is we just passed $10mm overall that we have FBAR filters that we have
shipped over the last roughly 12 to 18 months. And I don't know if we talked about a monthly rate. We are clearly
ramping to keep up with demand, but we have just passed the $10mm number. We can give you more resolution on
that at some point of time, I don't happen to have those number here though Richard. In terms of your second question
was around and related to where that's headed or what. Wasn't sure I got the second part of your question."
And we go next to Richard Shoe with SG Cowen.,"Yeah, the follow on, Richards, do you have any production design wins on E-pHEMT?","Yes, we do. We are continuing to work with our customers to be able to get approval to use those, actually we
have had a number of design wins just in the last 3 or 4 months. And we will be disclosing specifically who those are
since we get that approval but we can't really discuss who they are at this point."
Now we will be taking our next question from Alec Berming at [indiscernible] Capital.,"Hi, there. Just a followup question on the E-pHEMT reduction on the power amp. Are these guidelines you have
CDMA or GSM or they all [indiscernible] excellent piece of next [indiscernible] ratio and then also give us any sense
of monthly volumes of units you might generate on power amp, going forward either for the year or next quarter or the
quarter after that. Just give us sense of what kinds of volume there are?","I can't give you that level of detail, but we do have a good percentage of our volume with CDMA that was kind
of a initial focus. But we are certainly in the TSM area as well so I think it is kind of question of priority and where we
focus first and we have wins in both areas."
Now we will be taking our next question from Alec Berming at [indiscernible] Capital.,"Okay, can we get number of units to give some sense of obviously the CDMA market, how the margin is down,
you were talking do you have substantial share or a very small share or just some feeling as to how hard is
[indiscernible]?","I just don't have any numbers Andy I don't think any of us have that level of detail of projections for everyone of
our products. I am sorry and I don't think we can go to specific levels of detail we can give you general idea of share
and design wins and where we are focus and may be you can get back to Hilliard or somebody and get some more
detail on that but in terms of specific projections of how many units we are going to sale by Q4 we are just not going go
there."
And we will take our next question from Paul [indiscernible] from Thomas Weisel Partners.,"Hi, [indiscernible], mainly the question I have following up little bit on Richard was you where asked the level of
cost of goods was higher than the July quarter last year. What is the makeup of that, why is it?","Well, I will let Adrian answer I think again big portion [audio gap] looking at Q3. Are you looking at Q3, Q2 last year. Remember, we had the [indiscernible] starting up in Q3 of
last year. It is a little bit hard to, I do not if we can compare quarter to quarter and then prior to that. In Q2, we actually
had some early bills in anticipation of that. Some of those quarters are little bit funny [ph] in terms of the comparisons,
but again I would give you Q2 of last year we had $879mm cost of goods sold. It was $867 in Q1 of this year down, but
so was revenue from 1,457 down to 1412 ."
We will take your next question from Dillion Cathers [ph] at Value Line [ph],"Hi, I just had sort of a broad question for you. A lot of your competitors have remained in the black National
Instruments. National Instruments for one, do you think that the, that this next round of restructuring will bring around
a profit, assuming the economy does not get any worse and we don't go to war?","Well, certainly that's our plan, but, let me just make a general comment. If you look at the, the markets that we
are in, we have been in historically very different markets than National Instruments and some of our other competitors.
Our peak revenue for the company was $2.8B in Q4 of 2000. We have dropped to a run rate of about $1.45B and none
of our competitors that you mentioned like National or even Techtronics have dropped by that amount. If you want to
look at competitors that have been impacted like us. You know look at Digital Light Wave, look at Actona, look at
Paradyne, look at Credents, [ph]. You probably can not see but some of the Japanese competitors and private
competitors in the optical communications test market. We had a big percentage of our business that has been, that was
very focused around optical and communications test. That fell of the wagon and that is what we are scrambling to get
back to profitability with a significantly lower level of volume in those businesses, in some cases down as much as
80%. Also remember that we have a semiconductor test business, very cyclical business. Last quarter, we were the only
semiconductor test company making money. And so, we will get back to profitability there we are confident. So, you
can not compare us versus National, you have to look at our portfolio of businesses versus a portfolio of competitors
including Paradyne, including Actona, and a lot of the other people that have been impacted in a businesses like ours."
And we will take our next question from Chin Lee [ph] at Banc of America Securities.,"Hi, good morning gentlemen, I have kept two questions. First one is on cancellation, next to actually give us a
little more color into what was coming the $63mm coming from and second question is, perhaps Adrian can help us at
this one. Looking at the R&D spending, it is sort of been on the increase after Q3. Can actually comment, what is going
to happen if this is going to be happen, will we see an impact I guess from the recent announcement for the quarter?
Thank you.","Let me try on both of those. First, as far as cancellations, the $63mm of cancellations is actually a very good
performance. That's about as low as it ever gets for a business of this size. And as is usually the case, it will be in the
test and measurement and the automated test group is where there would be predominantly. As far as for R&D
spending, R&D spending has been scaling down for the past year, not going up. Again, I think perhaps some of you
have not got the all of the revised numbers that we issued a month ago on January 21, but to read the numbers
sequentially over the past five quarters, R&D spending was $305mm in Q1, $303mm in Q2, and $289mm in Q3. It did
go up to $298mm in Q4, but is now back down to $273mm in Q1. And that's about 19% of sales we have in fact
brought down R&D spending over the past year by about $25mm. And just a comment on the cancellations. What we see when we talk about cancellations is, customers are
changing their mind a lot. Their priorities shift, the programs get canceled, and on a $1.4B to $1.5B business having
some ongoing level of cancellations is not unusual, again, It will be nice if that was zero. But we think we are down to
roughly the ongoing run rate that we would expect, maybe a little bit higher, but certainly because of all the
uncertainty, but close to where we would expect to run, you know, on an ongoing basis just because of all the different
changes that goes on in customer priorities. One other element that is distinctable a lot [indiscernible] is that if we have a customer push out delivery beyond
six months, we consider that a cancellation. We only report bookings that are deliverable in the next six months. We
don not take them on, and we do not report them as a booking if it is beyond that, and if we get the certificates [ph]
pushed out, it is considered a cancelation. If it gets rebooked for the next quarter, it is a new order."
And we will go next to is Steven Comford [ph] with Pruvia Securities [ph].,"Hi there. Are you still targeting 50% gross margin and has you sort of worked through the plan? Can you try to
give on these volume levels, when could you get there? Thank you.","We have said all along Steve that a 50% gross margin would be at in operating level of around the $8B level,
meaning normal economic conditions again not these miserable conditions. Now, the truth is with these additional cuts
that we are making, we are able to bring that kind of a gross margin, or achieve that kind of a gross margin at a lower
level of volume than previously, by definition. But these are very difficult circumstances and we are not yet positioned
even after the $1.45B to get a 50% gross margin obviously if a business stays at these levels."
And we will take our next question from Stephen Blayle [ph] at Morgan Stanley.,"Craig, I think you had given me a comment about Semiconductor [indiscernible] and particular strength they are
expecting new orders from more into low end, which somewhat surprised me as I would think of a higher utilization
was on the high end. Can you provide any more details there?","Well, I think if you look, you know that's generally true if you look at the capacity utilizations today it tends to be
on the high end. In fact, on average if you look at the utilization of our testers, we think they are well over 90% and
those numbers supply in Taiwan and most of the virtually all the customers that we track. But again these things come
and go and I do not think we can get too excited about, you know, one quarter because we are going to see mix changes
from quarter to quarter based on which customers are buying, what they buy, what they bought last quarter, what they
are going to buy this quarter. So I don't get too excited about a quarter-to-quarter shift. If you go back and look at the
whole year as you have probably seen from the Prime Data report that was just recently issued, we believe we gained
about 6-7 points of market share last year. And in semiconductor and SOC test, even our memory test share went up by
a lot, close to 10 points. So, overall, you know, we think we are doing quite well but in terms of the mix of business, it
is going to shift around on a quarter-to-quarter basis. You are correct, that probably the biggest utilization is in the
some of the newer high-end devices that use the 0.13-micron processes and others. But we just happened to get some
orders from some applications that were for some lower end devices as well."
And we will be taking a follow-up question from Dean Gray of Goldman Sachs.,"Yes, a question each for Ned and Adrian. Ned, your question would be, can you comment on the changes in
management responsibilities in the quarter. Should that be viewed as a surprise that Byron had announced retirement
middle of the quarter and what should we think about Bill Sullivan, Chief Operating Officer taking on some operating
work, so some clarity there? And then for Adrian on the action by the rating agencies, what were their issues, was it the
cash burn and what is your expectation on Moody's? Thank you.","Well, the retirement of Byron was long planned. He turned 60 this year. He made it known to me about five years
ago that he had planned to retire when he was 60. So we have been working on a plan to transition that business to a
new leader for some period of time. But given the challenges that that organization has and I think the issues that they
have with getting back to profitability, I felt the best thing we could do in the near term was to have Bill Sullivan jump
in and help out. Bill is certainly one of our best operations managers in the Company. A lot of things he was working
on anyway as COO really were EPSG-related issues. The implementation of our Everest system, the restructuring of
our manufacturing, a lot of those things ended up being EPSG-related issues. So, asking him to do double duty for
some period of time here seemed to make sense to accelerate the change and give Bill an opportunity along with me to
continue to evaluate the alternative we have for long-term replacement for Byron and certainly our intention that this is
an interim move but it could last us as much as a year. And on top of this, remember that we moved some of Bill's
responsibilities to Adrian. Adrian has responsibility for IT and workplace services, which turned out to be about 80% or
more, he would say a 110% of his workload. So we have moved these two activities to Adrian. Adrian has managed
these activities before in his prior life. So, Bill is continuing to help me on some corporate issues, but probably
devoting 80% of his time or more to EPSG-related issues in the near term, while we get that business back to
profitability. As Adrian said earlier, you know, this is the business that has been furthest away from plan and
profitability and we are committed to get there by the end of this year."
And we will be taking a follow-up question from Dean Gray of Goldman Sachs.,"Dean, on your question of a rating agency move, frankly we have been pleased that the rating agencies hung in
there with us as long as they had. It is a obviously a very difficult situation for the rating agencies. They are looking at a
company that has been losing money consistently for 7 consecutive quarters and if despite all the progress that we are
making and in industries that are being served where our sales alone are down by 45% on a consolidated basis, the
outlook for some of the markets that we serve is not rosy and so it's really been an expression of faith and confidence in
us getting back to profitability quickly that's kept the rating agencies hanging in there as long as they did. If you
compared us to any sort of similar company and similar industries, we should have been downgraded 6 or 9 months or
even a year ago. Moody's with the latest warning did trip over, and we understand that. Obviously, we don't like it; it
has no consequences to us because we have no debt that is being affected by it and no imminent financing needs.
Moody's though they put us on watch for potential downgrade is still hanging in there with us because they believe our
story. They believe that we are working hard and successfully despite the climate that we are in to get back to a
break-even as soon as possible and certainly within this year, and they have confidence that based on the products and the technologies and the market positions that we have that once we get to break-even and with a little bit of fair sailing
from our markets, that we will begin to claim money, begin to be sustainably cash flow positive and that's the basis for
really hanging on to the extent that they have.","Operator, this is Hilliard. We are going to take two more calls and then wrap up the call."
